▌dont code anything, give me some options on how i can flesh out the e-comm part of this site. I
▌was thinking headless shopify integration but i guess that comes with the shopify fee. medusa js
▌came up but sounds like a brittle dev experience. what other choices do i have. i think shopping
▌cart is the basic thing i want but more features would be cool too

> Here are solid paths, from lowest-fee and simplest to fuller-featured.

  Minimal-Fee, Fastest

  - Stripe Checkout + lightweight cart: client cart + serverless checkout; pays only payment
  processing; limited catalog/inventory.
  - Stripe Payment Links: zero backend, “Buy” buttons per product; minimal flexibility.
  - PayPal/Square checkout buttons: quick to add; limited cart/UX control.

  Drop-In Cart (no backend to run)

  - Snipcart: add JS + data attributes; dashboard for orders, taxes, shipping; platform fee.
  - Foxy.io: similar drop-in cart/checkout; flexible data model; platform fee; stable vendor.
  - Lemon Squeezy: great for digital + subscriptions; handles tax/VAT; less ideal for physical.

  Headless SaaS (API-first, less ops)

  - Commerce.js (Chec): products, carts, checkout, discounts via API; fast to ship; monthly/
  platform fee.
  - Commerce Layer: robust headless for multi-market/complex pricing; pricier but scalable.
  - BigCommerce Headless: strong catalog/discounts; good APIs; standard SaaS pricing.
  - Shopify Headless: best ecosystem; fees apply; excellent stability and integrations.

  Open-Source / Self-Hosted Headless

  - Vendure (TypeScript/GraphQL): modern, pluginable, admin UI; you host; great DX vs Medusa.
  - Saleor (Python/GraphQL): mature, solid admin, OSS + cloud; you host or pay for cloud.
  - Payload CMS + Commerce: content + commerce in one Node app; self-host; evolving but compelling.
  - WooCommerce Headless: huge plugin ecosystem; WPGraphQL for headless; more maintenance.
  - Sylius/Magento Open Source: enterprise-grade, heavy to run; only if you need deep complexity.

  Add-On Building Blocks (mix as needed)

  - Taxes: Stripe Tax, TaxJar, Avalara.
  - Shipping/rates/labels: Shippo, EasyPost.
  - Search: Algolia, Meilisearch.
  - Subscriptions: Stripe Billing, Lemon Squeezy.
  - CMS: Sanity, Contentful, Payload.
  - Email/CRM: Klaviyo, Postmark.

  Quick Picks

  - Fastest, lowest ongoing fees: Stripe Checkout + simple cart; add Stripe Tax + Shippo later.
  - Minimal setup but richer features: Snipcart or Foxy.io on top of your existing pages.
  - Balanced control vs speed (no heavy ops): Commerce.js or BigCommerce Headless.
  - Full control, no platform fee, modern DX: Vendure or Payload Commerce self-hosted.
  - “Just works”, big ecosystem: Shopify (theme or headless) if fees are acceptable.

  How to choose (5 questions)

  - About how many SKUs/variants now and in 12 months?
  - Physical goods only, or digital/subscriptions too?
  - Need multi-currency, VAT, and negotiated shipping rates?
  - Any required integrations (POS, 3PL, ERP, CRM, email)?
  - Preference for no monthly platform fees vs less dev/ops?

  If you share answers to those, I’ll recommend a targeted stack and an incremental rollout plan
  (cart first, then taxes/shipments, then promos/CRM) with a rough cost/time estimate.
