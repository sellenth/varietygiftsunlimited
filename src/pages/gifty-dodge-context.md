 a camera that looks top-down onto the scene. the scene contains a tall green rectangle that represents a grassy field. there is a gift box player character located at the bottom of the camera viewport. when the screen is tapped, this gift box jumps in a fixed distance up. it should take 15 jumps to reach the top of the screen. when the player makes it to the 15th row, they win the level. 

Please come up with a cute design for the gift box character model. It will mostly be seen from the top down. It should be easy to identify on the screen and stands out from decorations and obstacles.

There will be obstacles/enemies that move horizontally across the screen like in frogger. delivery vans, clocks, "out of stock" text, And there will be a pair of hands at the top that accept the gift.

The theme is whimsical, pink, fun. 

the jump happens on keyup and click. I want the jump to be two phased, first when the key or click is down but hasn't been released yet, be in the  'charging' state, then when keyup or click is released, go into the 'jump' routine

[] red x should be "out of stock!" text
