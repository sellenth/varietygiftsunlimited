My problem was just that claude wasn't updated. I always saw the auto update notification at the bottom right of claude so I assumed I didn't have to manually do it. Maybe my setup is broken or whatever but running `claude update` fixed it. This is assuming you have a settings.json file properly configured for a hook. Here's an example of mine at ~/.claude/settings.json

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "afplay /Users/me/Music/bing.mp3"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "afplay /Users/me/Music/bing2.mp3"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## The Promise vs. Reality

When Claude Code first emerged, it promised to be the ultimate coding companionâ€”a tool that could understand context, write clean code, and help developers be more productive than ever before. And in many ways, it delivers on this promise. However, the reality is more nuanced.

## Context Window Limitations

One of the most significant challenges users face is the context window limitation. While Claude Code can process substantial amounts of information, large codebases often exceed these limits, leading to:

- Incomplete understanding of project structure
- Difficulty maintaining consistency across multiple files
- Challenges with complex refactoring tasks

## The Learning Curve

Despite its intuitive interface, Claude Code requires users to develop new skills in prompt engineering and AI interaction. Developers need to learn how to:

- Structure requests effectively
- Provide sufficient context without overwhelming the system
- Validate and review AI-generated code thoroughly

## Dependency on Human Oversight

Perhaps the biggest "problem" with Claude Code isn't a flawâ€”it's a feature. The tool is designed to augment human intelligence, not replace it. This means:

> "Claude Code works best when developers maintain active oversight, critical thinking, and domain expertise. It's a powerful assistant, not a replacement for developer judgment."

## Moving Forward

Understanding these limitations isn't about criticizing Claude Codeâ€”it's about using it more effectively. The developers who get the most value from AI-assisted coding are those who:

- Maintain realistic expectations
- Invest time in learning optimal usage patterns
- Combine AI assistance with traditional development practices
- Stay engaged in the development process

## Conclusion

Claude Code's "biggest problem" might actually be that it's so capable that users sometimes expect it to be perfect. By understanding its limitations and working within them, developers can harness its full potential while maintaining the quality and reliability their projects demand.

The future of AI-assisted development is bright, and tools like Claude Code are just the beginning. As we continue to evolve alongside these technologies, the key is finding the right balance between human creativity and artificial intelligence.
