# Puppeteer MCP Connection Helper

## Development Server Setup

### Starting the server
- Use `npm start` (not `npm run dev`) - this runs `astro dev --host`
- Server runs on HTTPS with multiple URLs:
  - Local: https://localhost:4321/ (but may use different port)
  - Network: https://192.168.0.101:4321/

### Debugging server connection issues
- If Puppeteer can't connect to expected port (4321), check actual listening port:
  ```bash
  netstat -an | grep LISTEN | grep -E '43[0-9][0-9]'
  ```
- Server may use port 4323 instead of 4321
- Use HTTPS URLs, not HTTP
- For Puppeteer MCP connection, use these settings:
  ```javascript
  {
    "allowDangerous": true,
    "launchOptions": {
      "headless": true, 
      "args": ["--no-sandbox", "--ignore-certificate-errors", "--allow-running-insecure-content", "--disable-web-security"]
    }
  }
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Start dev server with `npm start`
2. Check which port is actually listening with netstat
3. Use HTTPS protocol
4. Enable dangerous options and certificate ignore flags
5. Test connection with curl first if needed
